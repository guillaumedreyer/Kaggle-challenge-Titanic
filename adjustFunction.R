# A general classification algorithm such as RF tree or GLM may fail to detect some correlations
# in the outcomes of people travelling. For instance, it is very likely that if a mother did not survive,
# her children did not as well. Similarly, if one of the children in a family did not survive, it is certain
# that the father did not survive too. The fate of a passenger is thus binded to that of his/her surrounding.  
# The algorithm is designed to adjust or "harmonize" the outcomes for people in the same group.
